## Understanding data

```{r, echo=FALSE, purl=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
### Presentation of the survey data
```

To be able to do proper data analyses, it is crucial to understand your data before you can analyse it. So before we start doing any form of analyses we will first understand the dataset that we will be using throughout this course.  Let us first download the file and have a look at the data.  

We are going to use the R function `download.file()` to download the CSV file that contains the data.  
```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=TRUE}
download.file(url="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data/portal_data_joined.csv")
```
Inside the download.file command, the first entry is a character string with the source URL 
("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169"). This source URL downloads a CSV file from 
figshare. The text after the comma ("data/portal_data_joined.csv") is the destination of the 
file on your local machine. 

If you go in the Files section in RStudio, click on the `portal_data_joined.csv` file in the `data` folder and then click `View File` you will be able to see the content of the file.</span>

```
"record_id","month","day","year","plot_id","species_id","sex","hindfoot_length","weight","genus","species","taxa","plot_type"
1,7,16,1977,2,"NL","M","32","","Neotoma","albigula","Rodent","Control"
72,8,19,1977,2,"NL","M","31","","Neotoma","albigula","Rodent","Control"  224,9,13,1977,2,"NL","","","","Neotoma","albigula","Rodent","Control"
```
From the first 4 lines of the `portal_data_joined.csv` file displayed above, we can notice that the file is in the comma separated value (CSV) format which is a very popular format where different values are separated by a comma. The first line of the file is the header of the file which provides a title for each column.  In this dataset, we are studying the species repartition and weight of animals caught in plots in our study area. The dataset has the following columns, with each row holding information for a single animal:

| Column           | Description                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| record\_id       | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot\_id         | ID of a particular plot            |
| species\_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           |
| hindfoot\_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |
| genus            | genus of animal                    |
| species          | species of animal                  |
| taxon             | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit |
| plot\_type       | type of plot                       |


## Reading in data from a file

Now that we have looked at the raw format of the file (CSV format), let us load the data into R and look at how data is loaded into R.  We will use `read.csv()` to load into memory the content of the CSV file as an object of class `data.frame`. 

You are now ready to load the data:

```{r, eval=TRUE,  purl=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

This statement doesn't produce any output because, as you might recall,
assignments don't display anything. If we want to check that our data has been
loaded, we can see the contents of the data frame by typing its name: `surveys`.

Wow... that was a lot of output. At least it means the data loaded
properly. Let's check the top (the first 6 lines) of this data frame using the
function `head()`:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
head(surveys)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
## Try also
View(surveys)
```

## Data frames

Data frames are another data structure in R which is most widely used in the R programming world.  It is very popular as most of the data is readily available in tabular form and it is the also the data structure used when plotting and performing most analyses in R.  

A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the
columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are
vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers,
logical). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a
numeric, a character, and a logical vector.

![](./img/data-frame.svg)

In R we can see this by inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame
with the function `str()`:

```{r, results=TRUE, purl=FALSE, code_folding=show}
str(surveys)
```


### Inspecting `data.frame` Objects

As we mentioned before, it is important to understand your data before analysing it.  Furthermore we want to make sure that the data has loaded in R properly.  To do that, there are several functions we can use that help us to inspect our data.frame object.

We already saw how the functions `head()`, `view()` and `str()` can be useful to check the
content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of
functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let's try them out!

* Size:
    * `dim(surveys)` - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element,
          and the number of columns as the second element (the **dim**ensions of
          the object)
    * `nrow(surveys)` - returns the number of rows
    * `ncol(surveys)` - returns the number of columns

* Content:
    * `head(surveys)` - shows the first 6 rows
    * `tail(surveys)` - shows the last 6 rows

* Names:
    * `names(surveys)` - returns the column names (synonym of `colnames()` for `data.frame`
	   objects)
    * `rownames(surveys)` - returns the row names

* Summary:
    * `str(surveys)` - structure of the object and information about the class, length and  c
	   content of  each column
    * `summary(surveys)` - summary statistics for each column

Note: most of these functions are "generic", they can be used on other types of
objects besides `data.frame`.

> Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?
>
> * What is the class of the object `surveys`?
> * How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
> * How many taxa have been recorded during these surveys?
>
> ```{r, answer=TRUE}
> str(surveys)
>
> ## * class: data frame
> ## * how many rows: 34786,  how many columns: 13
> ## * how many taxa: 4
>

### Indexing and subsetting data frames  

#### Numeric indexing
You can think of a data frame as a table with rows and columns.  Each element in the data frame can be indexed by the position of the row and the column in respect to the whole data frame.  The index is specified as [R,C] where R is the position of the row (or row number) and C is the position of the column (or column number).  **Note that `[]` are used for indexing, while `()` are used to call a function**. Indexing in a data frame starts from 1.  To be able to extract specific data from the surveys data frame, we need to specify the indices or positions of the elements we want from it.   In the image below we zoom into the first three columns and rows of the surveys data frame and show their indexes displayed on top of their values in skyblue.  
![](./img/indexing_dataframe.svg)

The illustration above illustrates how **numeric indexing** works. Below are some examples of how we can retrieve subset of values from the surveys data frame using numeric indexing. 

```{r, purl=FALSE}
# get first element in the first column of the data frame
surveys[1, 1]   
# get first element in the 6th column
surveys[1, 6]   
# get first column of the data frame (as a vector)
surveys[, 1]    
# get first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
surveys[1:3, 7] 
# get the 3rd row of the data frame (as a data.frame)
surveys[3, ]    
# equivalent to head_surveys <- head(surveys)
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6, ] 
```

`:` is an operator in R that creates a sequence of numeric vectors of integers in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance.  It is equivalent to the function `seq(from, to)`.

You can also exclude certain indices of a data frame using the "`-`" sign:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys[, -1]          # get the whole data frame, except the first column
surveys[-c(7:34786), ] # equivalent to head(surveys)
```

<br/>

#### Name indexing
Data frames can be subset by calling indices (as shown previously), but also by calling their row names and column names directly.  This is known as **name indexing**. Below are some example of how we retrieve data from a data frame using column names. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# get species_id column as a vector
surveys[, "species_id"]     
# same as above
surveys$species_id          
# get the record_id and species columns for the first three rows
# Note: we are mixing numeric and name indexing here
surveys[1:3, c("record_id", "species")] 
```
In RStudio, you can use the autocompletion feature to get the full and correct names of the columns.

<br/>

#### Logical indexing
Another way to retrieve data from a data frame is by **logical indexing**, or in other words, by performing a logical operation on a data frame.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# get all the records that have species as "albigula"
surveys[surveys$species == "albigula",]
# save all the records that have species as "albigula" into a variable
albigula_data <- surveys[surveys$species == "albigula",]
# how many records have species as "albigula" in the surveys data frame?
nrow(albigula_data)
```

In case you are wondering what a *Neotoma albigula* is:
